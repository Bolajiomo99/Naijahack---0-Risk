    <p class="end-section">Thank you for using Maths Clinic app services, website (“Site”), and associated software (collectively, “Service(s)”). By accessing or using our Services, you are agreeing to the terms below.</p
    <h3>1. Overview</h3>

    <p>The terms below, as well as any additional terms accompanying Maths Clinic’s Services, and any applicable policies, operating rules, and procedures published on our website or any other website we maintain for purposes of providing Services, are referred to collectively as the “Terms.” By using Maths Clinic’s Services, you agree to comply with our Terms and that these Terms control your relationship with Maths Clinic and are legally binding. You understand that the use of our Services is restricted to those uses specified in the Terms. Maths Clinic may suspend access to its Services by you or your API/SDK Client without notice if we reasonably believe that you are in violation of the Terms. We maintain the right to revise these Terms at any time and you agree to be bound by the latest version of the Terms.</p>

    <p>Under the Terms, "Maths Clinic" means Maths Clinic Developer Services, Inc., a Delaware C Corporation, or any of its current or future subsidiaries, affiliates, successors or assigns. We may refer to "Maths Clinic" as "we", "our", or "us" in the Terms. We refer to the individual(s), application, service, or business named on Maths Clinic’s registration page or other API/SDK License Agreement as "you", "your”, or “user(s)”.</p>

    <p class="end-section">Maths Clinic provides Services that allow developers to integrate the services of mobile money providers in mobile applications. You understand that although our Services facilitate a connection with mobile money providers, Maths Clinic is not a bank, money service business, or a payments processor, and we cannot be held liable by you or your end-users for any products or services you build using Maths Clinic’s Services. There is no warranty for our Services, which are provided “as-is,” and you accept and assume any risk associated with use of the Services.</p>

Your use of our Services on behalf of that entity hereby confirms that the entity is bound to the Terms. You understand that any reference to “you” or “your” shall refer to that entity. If you are not properly authorized to bind your entity to these Terms, then you understand that you will be personally responsible for any pursuant damages relating to the use of Maths Clinic’s Services.</p>

    <p><span class="bold">c. Adherence to the Law.</span> By registering to use our Services you confirm that you do and will adhere to all relevant laws, regulations, and rules, including but not limited to those relating to financial and personally identifiable information (“PII”).</p>
